The Friday evening concert opened with an overture by Glazounoff played by the orchestra.  Ms. Pavlowa then performed, with other members of the company, Amarilla, a ballet in one act, music by Glazounoff and Drigo, arranged by Ivan Ciustine.  They performed Oriental impressions: three dances of Japan, a Hindu wedding, and Krishna and Rhada.  They ended the concert with several dances to music of Glinka, Saint-Saens, Strauss, Grieg and others.  The Saturday matinee performance opened with the same orchestral overture.  Ms. Pavlowa and company then performed A Polish Wedding, a ballet in one act, arranged by M. Pianowski, music by Krupinski, followed by another one act and two scene ballet, music by Bayer and others, arranged by Ivan Ciustine.  They ended the concert once again with dances to music by Liszt, Saint Saens, Gluck, Bizet and others.  The Saturday evening concert opened with an orchestral overture by Arensky.  Ms. Pavlowa and company then performed Old Russian Folk Lore, a ballet in one act,  arranged by Laurent Novikoff, music by Nicholas Tscherepnine, followed by a choreographic poem by Anna Pavlowa to music of Chopin, and dances to the music of Tschaikowski, Strauss, Grieg, Boccherini and other composers.; ||",1920-1929,"Heilig Theatre (Portland, Oregon); Ballets; Orchestral music--Performances; Dance--Performances; ",Multnomah County Library,concert programs,Text; concert programs,Text,application/pdf,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

Miss Hempel was assisted by Mr. Coenraad V. Bos, a Dutch pianist, and Mr. Louis P. Fritze, an American flautist.  Miss Hempel originally performed the Jenny Lind concert at the request of the Swedish Societies of New York.  They wished to honor the famous Swedish soprano on the centennial of her October 6, 1820 birth.  They chose Miss Hempel because of her beautiful soprano voice and also because of her similarity in looks to Jenny Lind.  Miss Hempel followed the program of that original concert, in a gown replicating that of Jenny Lind, in concert on October 6, 1920, in New York.  It was a very successful concert, and she repeated it at other locations during the 1920's.  At the Portland concert, as at others, she was dressed in the style of Jenny Lind in 1850.  According to a concert review article in the May 15 Oregonian, Mr. Bos and Mr. Fritze were also ""quaintly attired"" in 1850's style.  The program followed the wording and style of the Barnum programs used for Jenny Lind's American concerts (Jenny Lind came to America in 1850 at the invitation of P. T. Barnum and gave concerts for him before continuing to tour America under her own management).  Miss Hempel sang a Mozart aria and songs by Handel, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn and others, including a Norwegian melody known as ""The Echo Song,"" for which she played her own accompaniment as Jenny Lind had done, and Bird Song by Taubert, which had been composed for Miss Lind and sung by her for the first time in Boston in 1850.  Mr. Bos accompanied Miss Hempel on the piano and also played piano solos by Chopin, Mendelssohn and Soebeck.

The project represents an important example of the power of the intersection of community, public art, and public history. The artists include Isaac (now Isaka) Shamsud-Din (mural painter/project director), Charles Tatum (sculptor/project assistant director), Henry Frison (mural painter), Chonita Henderson Smith (mural painter), Jenny Harada Allen (mural painter), and Larry Scott (assistant mural painter). The mural panels hung from 1978 to 1983 on the exterior walls of the Albina Human Resource Center in the heart of North Portland's Albina neighborhood.  Unprotected and unmaintained, the deteriorating murals were eventually removed by the artists.

Hill was also heavily involved with the longshoremen’s union, serving as Vice President of ILWU Locals 92 and 8, despite being lead plaintiff against the latter in a 1968 discrimination lawsuit. Hill was also a member of the Portland Police Auxiliary from 1967 to 1969. In 1976 he was honored by the city of Portland and officially named a “hero” for intervening physically by placing his finger between the hammer and firing pin of a pistol when a man attempted to shoot a police officer during a traffic dispute. This photo was taken during a Portland School Board Meeting on April 12th of 1982. This protest by the Black United Front,  the second in as many weeks, was prompted by the school board’s decision to renege on a promise made as part of a previously negotiated desegregation plan to place a magnet program at Eliot School and rename the site Harriet Tubman Middle School. The board balked and decided to instead house the institution at the Boise School, an idea that was previously rejected by the BUF.

This section presents the slavery question (should Oregon be a slave state or a free state) and the Exclusion Laws, which prohibited black people from residing in Oregon. Voters approved the Exclusion Laws and decided Oregon would become a slavery-free state (with some exceptions). The outcome reflected the desire of new settlers to create a white utopian state of free labor and to avoid completely alienating either side of the slavery debate when the question of statehood came before Congress. The effects of that vote are apparent today, although the legal relevance of exclusion and slavery was made moot by the passage of the 13th and 14th Amendments.; ||",1850-1859,"Oregon; African Americans; Constitution (Oregon); Slavery--Legal status, laws, etc.; ",Oregon Historical Society Research Library,color photographs,StillImage; color photographs,StillImage,image/jpeg,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/

Originally formed under the name First Baptist Church of Burton Homes in 1944 Vancouver, Washington, most of the early congregants were African-Americans from the South who migrated to the Pacific Northwest seeking employment in the defense industry during World War II. The church was displaced twice after V-Day, once with the closing of the eponymous Burton Homes in 1945 and again when their new space at nearby the Bagley Downs housing projects was decommissioned. This prompted a move to segregated Portland’s Albina neighborhood, where  they joined a burgeoning Black enclave in 1946. During this period the congregation also changed leadership with appointment of O.B. Williams as pastor, a title he would hold for almost fifty years. After briefly occupying the Prince’s Hall Masonic Temple at 116 NE Russell, the congregation purchased & rehabilitated a dilapidated building at 1914 N. Vancouver in 1947 (subsequently this property was razed for the construction of I-5).  After relocating, the congregation changed its name to the now familiar Vancouver Avenue Baptist Church. In the aftermath of the Vanport flood in 1948 many residents from that housing project’s Community Baptist Church joined Vancouver Avenue. As more African Americans were forced to settle in Albina, Reverend Williams was pushed to seek another space just a few years after buying their first building. The shrinking Central Methodist Church, a congregation of mostly northern European immigrants, sold their building at 3138 N. Vancouver to O.B. Williams’ expanding flock. The new occupants marched down the street to their new home on Palm Sunday of 1951 and have continued to hold services at the space since. Church historian Raymond Burell spearheaded a successful effort to have this building placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 and it continues to function as a place of worship, civil rights landmark, and spiritual home for many Black Portlanders. This photo features the current building during the final stages of a renovation project in the late 1950s. Because banks were unwilling to make loans to African-Americans, O.B. Williams found capital for the expansion by borrowing against the value of a personal life insurance policy.; ||",1950-1959,"Portland, Oregon; African American neighborhoods; African American churches; African Americans--Segregation; African Americans--Civil rights; Williams, O.

Williams leads services in 1961 for the Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church in the Albina neighborhood of Portland. Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church is a revered institution that has consistently served as a hub of political, civic, & spiritual life in Portland’s African-American community since its inception. Started as the First Baptist Church of Burton Homes in 1944 Vancouver, Washington, most of the early congregants were African-Americans from the South who migrated to the Pacific Northwest seeking employment in the defense industry during World War II. The church moved twice after V-Day with the closing of the eponymous Burton Homes & Bagley Downs housing projects, prompting a move to segregated Portland’s burgeoning Black enclave in the Albina neighborhood in 1946. During this period the congregation also changed leadership with the appointment of O.B. Williams as pastor, a title he would hold for almost fifty years. After briefly occupying the Prince’s Hall Masonic Temple at 116 NE Russell, the congregation purchased & rehabilitated a dilapidated building at 1914 N. Vancouver in 1947 (subsequently this property was razed for the construction of I-5). The new home was also accompanied by a new name, Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church. In the aftermath of the Vanport flood in 1948, many displaced residents from that housing project’s Community Baptist Church joined Vancouver Avenue. As more African Americans were forced to settle in Albina, Reverend Williams was pushed to seek another space just a few years later.  The shrinking Central Methodist Church, a congregation of mostly northern European immigrants, sold their building at 3138 N. Vancouver to O.B. Williams’ expanding flock. The new occupants marched down the street to their new home on Palm Sunday of 1951 & have continued to hold services at the space since. Congregation historian Raymond Burell spearheaded a successful effort to have this building placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 & it continues to function as a place of worship, civil rights landmark, & spiritual home for many Black Portlanders.

The racist “prank” led to massive protests and public denouncements by city and state leaders, including Gov. Vic Atiyeh, and the establishment of a public police review board. The policemen were fired by Commissioner Charles Jordan (who was African American), but they were reinstated months later after Mayor Frank Ivancie removed Jordan as head of the Police Bureau and replaced him with Ron Still, a former commander of the Special Investigation Division in charge of investigating the Black Panthers. Through the efforts of civil rights leaders such as Ron Herndon, however, the incident served as a catalyst for police reform, including the creation of a public police oversight commission.

Started as the First Baptist Church of Burton Homes in 1944 Vancouver, Washington, most of the early congregants were African-Americans from the South who migrated to the Pacific Northwest seeking employment in the defense industry during World War II. The church moved twice after V-Day with the closing of the eponymous Burton Homes & Bagley Downs housing projects, prompting a move to segregated Portland’s burgeoning Black enclave in the Albina neighborhood in 1946. During this period the congregation also changed leadership with the appointment of O.B. Williams as pastor, a title he would hold for almost fifty years. After briefly occupying the Prince’s Hall Masonic Temple at 116 NE Russell, the congregation purchased & rehabilitated a dilapidated building at 1914 N. Vancouver in 1947 (subsequently this property was razed for the construction of I-5). The new home was also accompanied by a new name, Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church. In the aftermath of the Vanport flood in 1948, many displaced residents from that housing project’s Community Baptist Church joined Vancouver Avenue. As more African Americans were forced to settle in Albina, Reverend Williams was pushed to seek another space just a few years later.  The shrinking Central Methodist Church, a congregation of mostly northern European immigrants, sold their building at 3138 N. Vancouver to O.B. Williams’ expanding flock. The new occupants marched down the street to their new home on Palm Sunday of 1951 & have continued to hold services at the space since. Congregation historian Raymond Burell spearheaded a successful effort to have this building placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 & it continues to function as a place of worship, civil rights landmark, & spiritual home for many Black Portlanders.
